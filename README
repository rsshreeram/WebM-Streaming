Introduction
------------
This project deals with a WebM streaming solution using VP8 and vorbis for video 
audio respectively. The WebM container is still missing in the project which will
be done in the next version. The video and audio streaming are implemented as 
separate solutions with separate sockets for streaming purposes. The audio and 
video are not synchronized in this version.
