Content of the Folder:
---------------------

1. audiocapture.c	- contains source for audio capture from Mic   
2. audioplayback.c  	- contains source for audio playback
3. encoder.c  		- contains source for audio encoding
4. decocer.c		- contains source for audio decoding
5. Makefile		- Makefile for build
6. testAudiocapture.c	- testing Audio capture
7. testAudioplayback.c	- testing Audio playback
8. testEncoder.c	- testing Encoder
9. testDecoder.c	- testing Decoder

Binaries:
--------
1. To get the binaries run "make" in your shell terminal
2. To clean the folder run "make clean" in your shell terminal

Requirements:
------------
To use this audio binaries you must have libvorbis, libavcodec,
libasound and libvorbisidec installed in your computer. Use the 
synaptics package manager to install the libraries if they are 
not installed.


Testing the audio capture, playback, encoder, decoder:
-----------------------------------------------------
To test the audio capture create the binaries using the previous
method and run "./audiocapture > sample.raw" in your shell terminal.
you can provide any name instead of sample.raw. It is the output file
which contains the captures audio data.

To test the audio playback capture a sample audio using the previous
audio capture method and use the same output file like as shown below.
"./audioplayback < sample.raw". you can now hear the same audio you 
captured previously.

To test the Vorbis audio encoder use the same output file that you used
for playback e.g. sample.raw and encode using the below mentioned 
command.
"./encoder < sample.raw > sample.oga" 

The file "sample.vob" is the encoded audio file which has the same 
content as sample.raw. You can play the encoded file using vlc.
"./vlc sample.oga" 

To test the Vorbis audio decoder use any ogg audio file and play using 
the decoder.
"./decoder sample.oga"
